About the dataset


The dataset contains case counts and rates for selected communicable diseases—listed in the data dictionary—that met the surveillance case definition for that disease and was reported for California residents, by disease, county, year, and sex. The data represent cases with an estimated illness onset date from 2001 through the last year indicated from California Confidential Morbidity Reports and/or Laboratory Reports.
